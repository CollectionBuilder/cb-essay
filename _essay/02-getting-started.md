title: Getting Started with CB-Essay
order: 2
---

This guide walks you through creating your first CB-Essay project from scratch. You'll have a working essay site in about 10 minutes.

## Philosophy: Copy and Replace

This entire demo site is designed to teach through demonstration. Every feature you see can be **copied directly into your own essays**. See a blockquote you like? Copy the code, replace the content with yours. Find a useful margin note? Same approach.

**You don't need to understand the technical details** - just copy what works and replace the content.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A **GitHub account** (free) -- [Sign up now!](https://www.github.com/)
- A willingness to learn


## Step 1: Use This Template

CB-Essay is a GitHub template repository. This means you can create your own copy with one click:

1. Navigate to [github.com/CollectionBuilder/cb-essay](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/cb-essay)
2. Click the green **"Use this template"** button
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-essay-project`){% include essay/feature/aside.html
   text="**Tip:** Use a descriptive repository name. It will become part of your site's URL: `username.github.io/repository-name`" %}
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** (If you'd like to publish the site on GitHub's free GitHub Pages web hosting, it will need to be Public)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

**That's it!** You now have your own CB-Essay repository.

## Step 2: Choose Your Editing Workflow

You have several options for working with your essays. **Most CB-Essay users work directly on GitHub** without installing anything locally.

### Option A: Edit on GitHub.com (Easiest!)

Work entirely in your browser - **no local installation needed**:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click into the `_essay/` folder
3. Open `01-welcome.md`  and replace it's content with your own!
4. Do the same with the other `.md` files in the folder, renaming the filenames and replacing the "frontmatter" {% include /essay/feature/aside.html text="**Frontmatter** is the information at the top of each `.md` file that includes information like `title` and `order`; it's separated by `---` lines at the top and bottom." %} with your own info.  
   - See Step 3 below for more information on how to edit these files.
5. Edit the `_config.yml` file and the `_data/theme.yml` file to change the site's title, theme, featured image, and typography
6. Click **"Commit changes"**

**That's it!** 

{% include essay/feature/aside.html
   text="**Bonus:** Use the **Project Gutenberg extractor** (Actions tab) to populate your `_essay/` folder with a complete book automatically!" %}

### Option B: GitHub.dev (VS Code in Browser)

Get [a full VS Code editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) without leaving your browser:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Press the `.` (period) key **OR** change the URL from `github.com` to `github.dev`
3. Edit files in a full-featured code editor
   - Replace the content in the `_essay` folder with your own
   - Edit the `_config.yml` file and the `_data/theme.yml` file to change the site's title, theme, featured image, and typography
4. Use [Source Control panel](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor#commit-your-changes) (third option from the top on the far right) to stage and commit changes

**Perfect for:** Multiple file edits, search/replace, file management

### Option C: GitHub Codespaces (Cloud Development)

Get a complete development environment in the cloud:

1. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace**
2. Wait for environment to load (includes Jekyll!)
3. Edit files in VS Code interface
4. Preview with `bundle exec jekyll s`
5. Use terminal, extensions, and full IDE features

**Perfect for:** Testing features, previewing locally, advanced work

### Option D: Local Development (Advanced)

For local development with Git and Jekyll installed on your computer, follow the [CollectionBuilder-CSV walkthrough](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/csv-walkthrough/). CB-Essay uses the same setup process.

**Perfect for:** Offline work, full control, fastest preview cycle


## Step 3: Add Content (Two Options)

### Option A: Use the Gutenberg Extractor (Quickest!)

Want to start with a complete book? Extract one from Project Gutenberg:

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Click **"Extract Gutenberg Book"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Enter a book ID (e.g., `84` for Frankenstein, `1342` for Pride and Prejudice)
5. Click **"Run workflow"** button

Wait a minute - your `_essay/` folder will be populated with chapter files automatically! And your config files (`_config.yml` and `_data/theme.yml`) will be updated with the title, author, and cover image from Project Gutenberg.

**Find books:** Browse [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and get the ID from the URL.

### Option B: Write Your Own Essay

No matter which editing method you chose in Step 2, essays use the same format.

Create a file in `_essay/` named `my-first-essay.md` with this content:

```yaml
---
title: My First Essay
order: 1
---

## Introduction

This is my first essay using CB-Essay. I can write in **Markdown** with _formatting_.

Here's a paragraph with a [link](https://example.com).

## Another Section

- Bullet points work
- As expected{% include essay/feature/aside.html text="So do asides!"%}

### Subsections too

I can add blockquotes:

{% raw %}{% include essay/feature/blockquote.html
   quote="This is a quotation"
   speaker="Someone Important" %}{% endraw %}
```

Notice the **front matter** (between `---` lines):
- `title`: Your essay's title
- `order`: Controls navigation sequence (1, 2, 3...)

## Step 4: Customize Configuration

Edit two main configuration files:

### `_config.yml` - Site Settings

```yaml
title: "Your Essay Title"
author: "Your Name"
tagline: "A brief description"
description: "Longer description for search engines (160 chars)"
```

### `_data/theme.yml` - Appearance

```yaml
base-theme: essay  # or monograph for book-style

# Homepage image
image-style: full-image  # full-image, half-image, or no-image
featured-image: /assets/img/your-image.jpg

# Typography
base-font-size: 1.3em
base-font-family: Georgia
```

You can edit these files directly on GitHub or in any of the editors mentioned in Step 2.

## Step 5: Add More Essays

Create additional essay files in `_essay/`:

```
_essay/
├── 01-introduction.md   (order: 1)
├── 02-chapter-one.md    (order: 2)
└── 03-conclusion.md     (order: 3)
```

Essays will appear in navigation based on their `order` value, **not** the filename.

{% include essay/feature/aside.html
   text="**Pro tip:** Use order values like 10, 20, 30 instead of 1, 2, 3. This makes it easy to insert essays later without renumbering everything." %}

## Step 6: Deploy to GitHub Pages

When you're ready to publish your site:

### Set Up GitHub Pages with Jekyll Action

CB-Essay requires a GitHub Action to build properly. Follow the complete setup guide:

**[GitHub Pages Deployment Guide](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/deploy/actions/)**

**Quick summary:**
1. Go to your repository and click the **Settings** menu item at the end of the second row on the page
2. Click on the **Pages** section on the left-hand side. 
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. GitHub will suggest the Jekyll workflow - ignore it! You've already got that file. 
4. Go to your readme.md file in the root of your repository. 
5. Make and commit a small change -- just add space! 
6. Once you commit the change, the site will properly rebuild!

That's it! Every time you commit changes from there on out, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site.

### Commit Your Changes

- **GitHub.com:** Changes are already committed when you click "Commit changes"
- **GitHub.dev / Codespaces:** Use the Source Control panel to commit and sync
- **Local development:** Run `git add .`, `git commit -m "Add essay"`, `git push`

### View Your Live Site

After the GitHub Action completes (usually 2-3 minutes), visit:

```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/
```

**Your essay is live!** 🎉

{% include essay/feature/aside.html text="**Tip:** Watch the Actions tab to see the build progress. A green checkmark means your site deployed successfully!" %}

## Common First Steps

### Change Homepage Theme

Edit `_data/theme.yml`:

```yaml
# Essay theme - linear reading
base-theme: essay

# Monograph theme - table of contents on homepage
base-theme: monograph
```

### Add a Featured Image

1. Add your image to `assets/img/`
2. Update `_data/theme.yml`:

```yaml
featured-image: /assets/img/my-banner.jpg
```

### Adjust Typography

```yaml
base-font-size: 1.4em  # Larger text
base-font-family: Georgia  # Serif font for traditional feel
text-color: "#191919"
link-color: "#0d6efd"
```

## Workflow Tips

### GitHub.com Workflow (Most Common)

1. Navigate to `_essay/` folder
2. Edit existing file or create new one
3. Make your changes
4. Commit directly to main branch
5. Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
6. Visit your site URL to see changes

**That's it!** No git commands needed.

### GitHub.dev / Codespaces Workflow

1. Edit multiple files as needed
2. Open Source Control panel (git icon)
3. Review changes
4. Write commit message
5. Click ✓ to commit
6. Click sync/push button
7. GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically

### Local Development Workflow

See the [CollectionBuilder-CSV walkthrough](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/csv-walkthrough/) for complete local setup instructions.

### File Organization

Keep your project organized:

```
your-project/
├── _essay/           # Your essay content (Markdown)
├── _data/            # Metadata CSV for collection items
├── assets/
│   └── img/          # Your images
├── _config.yml       # Site configuration
└── _data/theme.yml   # Theme settings
```

## Troubleshooting

### Essay doesn't appear on site

- Check front matter has `title` and `order`
- Verify file is in `_essay/` directory
- Check for YAML syntax errors

### Changes not showing

- **Local:** Wait for Jekyll to rebuild (watch terminal)
- **GitHub Pages:** Wait 2-5 minutes after pushing
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Navigation broken

- Ensure essays have sequential `order` values
- Check no duplicate order numbers
- Verify front matter is valid YAML
